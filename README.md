# Data Structures Final Project

This project involved creating a calculator which would perform the four basic calculations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, but to enter the string to be calculated in infix notation. 

As the program evaluates the expression, it first converts the infix notation to postfix notation, and then the mathematical expression is calculated, outputting the expected result. 

The program also includes a few exception classes to handle string inputs of expressions that are not syntactically or semantically correct. There is also a test case so that the user does not input an expression that involves dividing by zero.

This project built upon what was taught over the course of the semester as we had to use the stack template class to both create an algorithm that would convert a string from infix to postfix notation, and to evaluate the postfix expression, outputting a final calculated result.
